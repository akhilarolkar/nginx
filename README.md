üåê Nginx Server + Reverse Proxy + Load Balancer with HTTPS

This project demonstrates how to set up Nginx as a static file server, reverse proxy, and load balancer with HTTPS redirect.
There are 2 backend containers and 1 nginx container created using docker-compose file.

Features: \
Static file serving ‚Üí from /frontend/index.html \
Reverse proxy ‚Üí /api/ requests are forwarded to backend services \
Load balancing ‚Üí Nginx alternates between backend1 and backend2 containers \
HTTPS enabled ‚Üí with self-signed certificate

üìÇ Project Structure
. \
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml #to run nginx and backend containers \
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nginx.conf #nginx configuration file \
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/ \
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html \
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ssl/ \

STEPS TO RUN THE PROJECT

### 1) Clone this repo.
### 2) Generate self-signed SSL certificates. Run inside the ssl folder using git bash terminal:  
Generate private key : \
openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048 \
Generate self-signed certificate (valid for 1 year) : \
openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -subj "//CN=localhost"

This creates: \
server.key ‚Üí private key \
server.crt ‚Üí certificate

### 3) Open Docker Desktop.

### 4) Start services with Docker Compose.
docker compose up -d --build

This will start:

backend1 ‚Üí responds with ‚ÄúHello from backend1‚Äù \
backend2 ‚Üí responds with ‚ÄúHello from backend2‚Äù \
nginx ‚Üí serves static site + reverse proxies /api/

### 5) Access the application.
üåç HTTP: http://localhost  will be auto redirected to -> üîí HTTPS: https://localhost

‚ö†Ô∏è Since the certificate is self-signed, your browser will show a security warning. You can safely proceed for local testing.

refresh https://localhost/api/ multiple times to check load balaning between backend1 & backend2

### 6) Stopping Services
docker compose down
